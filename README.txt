Exploratory Data Analysis on Cardiographic Dataset

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook for performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a cardiographic dataset. The analysis aims to uncover insights, identify patterns, and understand the dataset's structure using statistical measures and visualizations.

## Contents:

### Data Overview:
- Understanding the dataset and its key features.
- Identifying the types of variables (numerical, categorical).
- Checking for missing values and handling them.

### Basic Statistics:
- Calculation of mean, median, mode, and standard deviation for numerical columns.
- Interpretation of statistical measures to gain insights.

### Data Visualization:
- Histograms to analyze the distribution of numerical variables.
- Boxplots for identifying outliers and understanding spread.
- Pairplots and correlation heatmaps to examine relationships between features.

### Data Preprocessing:
- Handling missing values and outliers.
- Feature selection and transformation techniques.
- Standardization of numerical variables for consistency.

## Objective:
The primary goal of this project is to:
1) Explore and summarize the dataset using EDA techniques.
2) Visualize distributions and relationships between features.
3) Identify trends and key insights that can aid further analysis.
4) Preprocess the data for better interpretability.

## Key Findings:
- The dataset revealed distinct trends in fetal heart rate patterns.
- Statistical summaries helped identify potential anomalies in the data.
- Correlation analysis provided insights into relationships between variables.
- Visualizations highlighted outliers and trends, aiding further decision-making.
